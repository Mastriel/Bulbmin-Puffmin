  <h1>Bulbmin + Puffmin</h1>
  <p>Bulbmin makes all single-player (PC) games multiplayer! <a href="https://bulbmin.calathea.dev/">Visit the web client.</a></p>
</div>


## Features
- Allow for (practically) infinite simultaneous connections.
- Killswitch global hotkeys to stop or pause all keyboard inputs.
- A free-to-use server, so you don't have to port-forward and share your own IP address.
- Performant, should not cause issues with network speed or traffic, nor RAM or CPU.
- Low latency, less than 70ms.
- Only the host needs to download an application. Others can use the web client to connect.
- Web client works on mobile!

## What this is not
- Bulbmin does not provide a way to stream your desktop. You must use another platform like Discord to share your screen with participants.

## Why is it named Bulbmin and Puffmin?
- In Pikmin 2, a hidden type of Pikmin is buried in the caves of the game, named Bulbmin. These are revealed to be parasitic Pikmin that have taken
control of a Bulborb as their host. Much like the web clients are 'parasites' on the host computer.
- Puffmin is named for a very similar reason.  

## Puffmin
Puffmin is the server that acts as a mediator between the web client and the Bulbmin desktop client. As a user, you don't have to worry about this.
However, you can self-host a Puffmin server that the web client and desktop client are able to connect to. (WIP, only Bulbmin Control Panel can connect 
to custom servers without edits to BulbminWeb)
